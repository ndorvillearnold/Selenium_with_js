Issues I ran across: Which command to use to run files and I had to use 

command : npm test


instead of node index.js. I also changed the path in the script in package.json
to to "scripts": { "test": "node tests/test.js". after research this is what was
noted: Consistency: npm test is a standard convention across Node.js projects

cant call node on an import.
