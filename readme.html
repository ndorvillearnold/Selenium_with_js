FOLDER STRUCTURE: I created an index.js file. so any other files thats created,
import / require it there so it can be included with the index.jsthe file is
ran. Issues I ran across: Which command do I use to run files? Run command : npm
test instead of node index.js. I also changed the path in the script in
package.json to to "scripts": { "test": "node tests/test.js". after research
this is what was noted: Consistency: npm test is a standard convention across
Node.js projects cant call node on an import. email
